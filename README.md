👋 Hi, I’m @Nmaster88

I'm a Portuguese citizen that was lucky to get into the world of Software Development.

It started as a curiosity that i explored in University and that turned later into a
career.

Software is growing in importance in my life and the life of many people, because it has the
power of bringing us a lot of useful innovations and enhancements to our lifes.

I want to keep improving my knowledge in this field and building great software.
